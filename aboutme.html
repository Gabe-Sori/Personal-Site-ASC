            <p class="text">Hi my name is Gabriel Soriano and I was born in San Juan, <a href="https://www.discoverpuertorico.com/" target="_blank"> Puerto Rico</a>. My parents  are from the <a href="https://www.godominicanrepublic.com/" target="_blank"> Dominican Republic </a> making me not just Puerto Rican but also Dominican. I was raised in Puerto Rico for 4 years which at the age of 4, I moved to America. That's when I had to start all over again: making new friends, learning a new language, getting used to the enviroment and exploring a whole new city. Because of this my mom took my brother and I to every borough. The <br> borough that I had the most fun in was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" target="_blank">Manhattan</a> because that's where my mom took us to go ice skating (ice skating is one of my favorite hobbies).</p>

        <div class="collapsible-text1">
            <p class="text2">I had always loved baseball baseball, whether it was watching, playing, or <br> practicing it. The issue about it was that I couldn't play it when I was <br> younger. The reason for this is because my parents were always busy with <br> work and never had the time to sign me up for a team. Since that was an <br> issue I decided to just practice alone at a park or some place where there <br> is a lot of space. Not being able to play in a team wasn't always the case. <br> Once I reached High School, I was finally given the option. I decided to <br> give baseball a try since I liked it my whole life and tryouts went pretty <br> good... The only issue was I was 251.4lbs. I could barely move fast enough <br> to make plays so I was benched the whole season. Sophomore Year I came <br> back with a new plan. I lost 20lbs. I was now able to move a bit quicker <br> and become a starter at 1st Base. Then I realized I want to win awards for <br> playing baseball, so my plan for this summer was to lose a lot of weight. <br> So I did! Junior Year I am 190lbs moving way faster than before and this <br> time  I was able to play multiple positions. This year I was able to exceed <br> my goal by not only winning 1 but 2 awards.
